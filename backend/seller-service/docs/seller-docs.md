found new type of bug....while working on seller dashboard if u are passing data in a get method it will directly work using postman....but was callliung this api from internal means service to service call there it was saying not authorized.....then chnaged the method from get to post...then it was working.....

seller service turned out to be a new learning thing, since in this i got lost betwen multiple api calls & then thinking about the caching since same data is being calle from wole multiple services/......& then again getting lost betwn redis deplyement & setup then came redis cloud in a picture just like a mongo atlas....so no hosting tenson of redis db.....
