# Auth Documentaion 

> Note: Dont expect to be grammatically correct....i am just writing stuffs for guidance & what new i am learning, nothng more!!

learnt about validation......already knew but never used a much.....but now using it with joi....would have choosen jod if its ts based .....

yup added the enter prise grade backend steup for robust scalable architecture.....
added

RBAC - role based access 
validation, global error handling, response formatting, also catch async so developer dont have to write same try cath block again & again.....

today - 2nd october......didnt felt like codingg but still doing....
yeah what i done is chnaged the token for the security....didnt felt like doing but it was needed...at first i thought of idea adding a tokenCount no in db schema also in token while signing.....so in middleware we can compare the token count no from db & token if same then u can access ....might be so much secure....but problem is .....multi device problem.....since after logging in nother device it will +1 the count in db ....& the other device it wont work....

so at the end done refreh token & access token & added config & generte token utility.....i may can consider auth service is complete...
